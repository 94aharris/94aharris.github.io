subtitle: Why did I Make Yet Another Script Blog?
---

My name is Anthony Harris and PowerShell keeps me sane.

- During day to day operations I don't have to check hundreds of disks
- Launching Virtual Machines has never been easier or more code driven
- Handling outages and locating the source of a problem is much faster

In 2013, I joined my first "Enterprise" Admin team. By that I mean joining a team that was responsible for managing and monitoring not a dozen or so servers, but over a hundred (and growing!). At this scale, scripting and automation go from being a "nice to have" to being an absolute necessity. 

Our group was small, but motivated. Diligently checking disk space, parsing through server logs, and other tasks all by hand. Things that fell through the cracks were often just due to the infeasibility of finding the problem manually.

A week or so in, I experianced my first Outage. The team had missed something with our manual checks which was also missed by the metric monitoring system. When the root cause analysis was done a question came down from managment:

*What is your team going to do to prevent this from happening again?*

Maybe it was just the new guy in me trying to make a name for himself but I felt like there was a better way to approach the problem. I told the team I would script that particular check with PowerShell.

Little did I know that first script would not only end up changing my career trajectory, but my entire outlook and approach to Administration.

### The Point of This Blog

The first point of this blog is to serve as a way for me to reenforce my own learning and understanding. For myself, I have always found that the best way for me to solidify my understanding of a topic is to teach others. There may be a few "Rant" posts, but for the most part posts will follow a format of:

"This is was the Problem -> This was my Solution -> and this is how I refined it"

Second, this is to serve as a way to "Pay it forward" to the next generation of PowerShell Admins. When I wrote my first script it was not a Book or Windows PowerShell documentation that got me through it, rather it was the help of anonymous admins who had encountered similar problems and written about how they solved it.

Lastly, it is my small stab at chronicalling my own work so that in a few years I can look back and evaluate my own growth.
